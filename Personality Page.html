        <p>While personality tests can give great insight, I find them sometimes a bit triggering. I remember doing one in January 
            of this year and I was excited by the results and thought to myself this is so amazing because it seemed to describe 
            me perfectly.</p>
        <p>   Fast forward to now when we are almost at the end of the year and it was such a challenge answering these questions 
            because where I am now is not where I was in January. It was hard answering some of these questions because 
            they were so absolute and I feel like I was neither of the choices presented but more in the middle. 
            I guess its because we are always changing.

        <h2><strong>Chapters 4 – 7 of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h2></strong>
        <p>The book 12 Pillars is about a oung man engaging in a dialogue with a groundskeeper employed by an affluent family. 
            During their conversation, the maintenance man tells him that if he wants to have a good life, he must follow
            twelve pillars.</p>
        <p>Chapter four speaks on goal setting. We’ve always been told the value of setting goals it almost seems at this point that it has become an art, 
            from vision boards to the technicalities like goals needing to be SMART. So much information and yet for many of us
            once we do the exercise in that group setting we never actively pursue them. The result is almost always we 
            find ourselves it a rut because of it. The line that really resonated with me in this chapter was ‘You cannot change your 
            destination overnight, but you can change your direction overnight.’ One of the greatest things in life is that it’s
            never too late to start over. We are the masters of our future and that change can happen at any moment. For me that 
            was deciding to go back to school and pursue a new career path. 
        </p>
        <p>Chapter 5 spoke on seizing opportunities. I can relate on so many levels with the character Micheal, that is having a family and having a career where 
            you feel unfulfilled and a salary that only covers the bills. The words “we must all suffer from one of two 
            pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs 
            tons’ hit me so hard. More truer words have never been said. While I know that many people would be happy to have 
            what I have or be where I am, I have many regrets. Nobody tells you that the weight of regrets that will leave you 
            feel like you are standing on the edge of a cliff or buried 6 feet under when the cares and responsibilities of 
            life are added. I now understand why people apply so much pressure to their kids. It’s nothing but the fear of 
            them getting to a certain age and having nothing but regrets and failures to show. I like the solution that was 
            offered and that is “Every day has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity. Your best opportunities are 
            those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on.” This is something that I will 
            most definitely try to implement and that is trying my beast each day to identify that best opportunity and capitalize 
            on it.</p>  
        <p>Chapter 6 was about choosing wisely the people who you surround yourself with. 
            At this point in my life, I don’t have a lot of close friends it more like family... does the advice to disassociate 
            from people who are not positively impacting your life based on their station in life apply to family too? How do I fix 
            that. I also remember thinking that it’s not easy to surround ourselves with rich successful people, if it were so 
            then we all would have rich successful friends. These circles are often times very closed, and getting access to certain 
            individuals are a challenge in itself. However, I as read on I found his solution quite reassuring and that is we will 
            attract who we ourselves become. Therefore, the more I work on myself and grow into the happy successful person I see 
            myself becoming then I will eventually find myself amongst like-minded people and enter that circle.</p>
        <p>Chapter 7 really caused me to introspect and admit that one major chnage I need to  to make, is that of becoming 
            a lifelong learner and not depending on formal education to take me to where I want to be, it is never enough. 
            We are living in an age where anything with too many words even text messages become a turn off, for me that is. 
            This book is the first book outside of school I have read in a while, and I know its impact has been profound. 
            It is a problem that I definitely intend on changing and I will be adapting that reading list. I plan on starting 
            over the December break. Although this assignment started out as a chore, I really appreciate the lessons learnt. </p>
